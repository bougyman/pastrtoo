phrik, aolbonics: <reply> aolbonics is using unnecessary abbreviations such as 'u', 'r', 'ur', 'thx', etc. Using this language depicts you as an imbecile in the eyes of the helpful regulars in this channel, and is generally not tolerated. If you want intelligent answers, the least you can do is speak intelligently. Additionally arguing about this rule will get you nowhere except banned. Have a nice day!
